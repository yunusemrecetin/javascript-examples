## Description

This program uses a built-in __net__ module in order to create a TCP server which listens to port __8000__. Then for each connected client, it responds with whatever the client writes. Here the __socket__ variable represents the client and is a __Duplex Stream__ which means it both has a __write__ method and __data__ event. So the code can also be written as ``` socket.on("data", (read) => socket.write(read));```. However, this is a bad practice since __Readable Streams__ can be piped to __Writable Streams__ and __Duplex Streams__ are both __Readable__  and __Writable__. So the idiomatic way of achieving this is by writing ```socket.pipe(socket);``` (Which is how our example is written).
